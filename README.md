# Address_API

## Task

We are building a neighbourhood collaboration site and we want to make a system to keep track of people, houses, and addresses of those houses.

Each person has a name, age and number of people in their household
Each house has an address and an owner
Each address has a postcode and street address
The REST API will need to enable users to:

Store people, houses and addresses
Look up a house, its address and owner
Look up people in our neighbourhood within certain age brackets and with specific household sizes
